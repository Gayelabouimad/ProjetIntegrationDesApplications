# ProjetIntegrationDesApplications
## A. How to run the Project
Shell #1 (any path)
> ``` mosquitto ```

Shell #2 (./ProjetIntegrationDesApplications) - **make sure to open docker tool box before running this command**

> ``` docker-compose up ```

## B. Backend (To build Locally)
to build one of the microservices. example :
go to backend/booksservice and run

> ``` npm install ```

then run

> ``` node app.js ```

**If you want to use a live reloading engine** run the following command:

> ``` npm i -g nodemon ```

and then instead of running `node app.js` , use `nodemon app.js`

this tool will re-run the backend every time a change is made

## C. Frontend (To build Locally)
to build the front end go to /frontend/my-app and run

> ``` npm install ```

then run

> ``` ng serve ```

then in your browser

> ``` localhost:4200 ```

## D. MongoDB commands (To Run MongoDB Locally) 
Open the shell and write down this command

> ```mongod --bind_ip <YOUR_IP_ADDR>```

Then in another shell

> ```mongo.exe <YOUR_IP_ADDR> ```

## E. MongoDB commands (To create a DB)
In order to create a Database

> ``` use <DB_Name> ```

In order to create a collection

> ``` db.createCollection("<Coll_Name>")```

In order to add a row to the collection

> ``` db.<Coll_Name>.insert({<all the key-value pairs>})```

In order to get all the collection

> ``` db.<Coll_Name>.find()```

## F. How does the FRONTEND WORK
### _F.1. Fetching data in the front-end (Books Section)_
In order to fetch data, you need to create a service. To do that :

1. Open the terminal in the services folder then write this command

> ``` ng generate service <service_Name> ```

*Example: "ng generate service booksService"*

2. In this service you will need to do an Http request so you need to import the Http module in the app module

> ```import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http'; ```

and place HttpClientModule under the imports array in NgModules

3. Now after importing it in the app module, you need to configure the service. You should import the http client in the service as follows:

> ``` import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http'; ```

then add it to the constructor in order to use it in the functions to make the call

> ```   constructor(private http: HttpClient) { } ```

Also, you should import http headers in the service :


>> ``` import { HttpHeaders } from '@angular/common/http'; ```

without adding it to the constructor so you can set the headers.

4. To make the call to the back end, create the function getSomething() as follows

> ```
>  getBooks() {
>    const httpOptions = {
>      headers: new HttpHeaders({
>        'Content-Type':  'application/json',
>        Authorization: 'my-auth-token'
>      })
>    };
>    return this.http.get('http://192.168.99.100:8080/getBooks', httpOptions);
>  }
>  ```

5. this function will be used in the books container component as follows

```
  constructor(private booksService: BooksServiceService) { }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.showBooks();
  }

  showBooks() {
    this.booksService.getBooks()
    .subscribe((data) => {
      this.books = data;
    });
  }
```
In order to use this service we should inport it in the component

> ``` import { BooksServiceService } from '../services/books-service.service'; ```

6. After fetching the data in the component ts file. we should show it in the html.
Since the data in ts is binded to the data in the ts we can simply use the books object that's in the ts by using {{ books }} in the html file as follows

```
<div *ngFor="let book of books">
  {{book.name}}
</div>
```

As the code above shows we are looping over the array(books) of objects(book) using *ngFor
then for each book we are displaying its name

we have used angular material library as follows:

```
<!-- loop over the books -->

<mat-list-item *ngFor="let book of books">
  <h4 mat-line>{{ book.name }}</h4>

  <!-- book state : Available or Taken, if statement used below -->
  <p *ngIf="book.status == 0; else notShow" style='color: blue'>Available</p>

  <ng-template #notShow>
    <p style='color: red'>Taken</p>
  </ng-template>

  <mat-divider></mat-divider>

</mat-list-item>
```


## G. Docker and Co..
### Definition

**What is Docker?**

- Enterprise-ready container platform
- Provides security and governance
- Automation by design
- Support and certification

Docker takes advantage of a concept called containerization.

- It solves the problem of how to reliably move software between environments
- Encapsulates the entire runtime environment
- Includes the application and its dependencies, libraries and other binaries

Docker and Virtual box cannot be installed on the same machine and work simultaniously because of Hyper-V.
So in order to use docker we install **docker tool box** from [](https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases)
after installing it, click on **docker quickstart terminal**. When its done, we can now use docker

As an example we can test the following command

> ``` docker run hello-world  ```

or

> ``` docker run -it ubuntu bash ```

In order to see all the docker processes that are running, open another command line and write the following command:

> ``` docker ps ```

In order to see all the docker images, write the following command:

> ``` docker images ```

In order to stop a container, write the following command from another cmd:

> ``` docker stop <Container_Name> ```

or
> ``` exit ```

To create a container

> ``` docker run --name <container_Name> -it <image_name> ```

To remove a container

> ``` docker rm <container_name or container_ID>```

### DockerFile

A docker file is the main configuration of the docker container. We can set all we need in a single file as follows

Here we are setting the environnment (we need the node package in this container so we pull it)

> ``` FROM node:latest```

now we need to copy all the booksservice folder to the container
. means the current directory and /src is the destination folder rin the container
> ``` COPY . /src ```

now we should set the working directory in the container

> ``` WORKDIR /src ```

and we need to specify the command that should be ran before building the service which is npm install so we install all the dependencies

> ``` RUN npm install ```

in order to make the calls to the backend we call on port 8081. now that the service is in the container. the container looks like a black box so we should call the container's port. this port should be binded to the microservices port which is 8081 so we expose port 8081

> ``` EXPOSE 8081 ```

after setting everything we should start the app (microservice) so we set the command

> ``` CMD node app.js ```

### Docker-Compose

if we have multiple docker file it is better to create a docker compose which will run them all.

```
version: '3'
services:
# Service #0 API Gateway
  apigateway:
    build: ./APIGateway
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
# Service #1 Books Service
  books:
    build: ./booksservice
    ports:
      - "8084:8084"
# Service #2 Customers Service
  customers:
    build: ./customersservice
    ports:
      - "8082:8082"
# Service #3 Orders Service
  orders:
    build: ./ordersservice
    ports:
      - "8083:8083"
# MongoDB
  mongo:
    container_name: mongodb
    restart: always
    image: mongo
    volumes:
      - ../data/db:/data/db

  mongo-express:
    image: mongo-express
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"

```

above is the docker compose file
we specify the build file which is the docker file
and we bind the ports local to container's

## H. MQTT
This service will provide a way to make the messaging between the different microservices




<!--
## NGINX
This tool will help us make load balance and acts as an API Gateway.

there are three methods of Scalability
- Run multiple copies behind a load balancer
- Split the app into multiple services
- partition the data using data shards

The goal is to split traffic among multiple servers
most common scaling solution
can be deployed as single or multiple services per server

**What is NGINX?**
- web server
- load balancer
- Reverse/ Forward Proxy
- Cache manager

how to install it on ubuntu :
first we should create the container

> ``` docker run --name NGINX_APIGATEWAY -it ubuntu ```

once the image is created the shell is an ubuntu shell. write the following commands

1. ``` apt-get update ``` to update the packages
2. ``` apt-get install nginx ``` to install nginx
in order to run it we need to type nginx on a specific port so

3. ``` exit ```

4. ``` docker commit <image_ID> <choose a repo name> ```
example : docker commit 1f0c95423750 nginx_micro

5. ``` docker run -it -p 8083:80 nginx_micro ```

now we are running an ubuntu image in our container

6. ``` service nginx start ```

now open chrome and type :

``` http://192.168.99.100:8083/ ```

(we used 192.168.99.100 instead of localhost because we are using docker toolbox)

we are redirected to welcome to nginx

### Load balancing with NGINX

- use the upstream directtive to declare servers
- use the proxy_pass directive to create the load balancer

example:
micro 1 : 162.243.144.211   8081
micro 2 : 162.243.144.211   8082
Same server but diffrent ports

Config file is located in /etc/nginx/available-sites/default

first we should set the upstread to point to the micros

> ``` upstream microservices {
>       server 162.243.144.211:8081
>       server 162.243.144.211:8082
> }
> ```

Then set the server to listen to port 80 or 443

> ```
> server {
>     listen 80;
>     location/{
>         proxy_pass http://microservices
>     }
> }
> ```

So whenever we navigate to the port 8081 we can find the docker image running that points to the nginx server
